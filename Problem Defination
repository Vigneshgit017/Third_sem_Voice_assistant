Voice assistants are commonly built on artificial intelligence, machine learning and voice 
technology. As the end user interacts with the digital assistant, the AI programming uses 
difficult algorithms to understand from data input and get itself better at predicting the user's 
needs. Some assistants are built with more advanced technologies which will allow a digital 
assistant to understand and carry out multi-step requests with numerous interactions and 
perform more complex tasks, such as booking seats at a movie theater. 
Digital assistants can be contrasted with another application of consumer-facing AI called 
smart advisors. Smart advisor programs are knowledge-oriented, while digital assistants are 
task-oriented, although some perform both roles. Popular voice assistants currently include 
Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa , Google Now, Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortan
